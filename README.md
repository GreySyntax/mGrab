What is mGrab?
================================
mGrab is a miniature API wrapper for TinyGrab '2.0', this was origonally developed by [NSPwn](http://www.nspwn.com) for SB2Cloud. This is designed to work within SpringBoard on iOS so yeah it might not work for you.

How do i use it?
================================
The implementation file is self explanatory. [mGrab error] will contain the last error message, [mGrab url] will return the url of the last upload.

TODO
================================
Implement login, just returns NO for now.
